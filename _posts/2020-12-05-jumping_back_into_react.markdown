Hi there everyone!

Recently, I have been learning Java, so I haven't been showing as much love to React and JS. I wanted to fix that by starting a React project. This time, I'm going to be doing one of the classic example React projects - the calculator app!

As I am just starting as of this writing, I don't have anything to show just yet. However, as I am beginning to sketch out my application, I have somewhat of an idea of what the layout is going to look like.

My components will be as follows:

  -App
	-Calculator
	-Display
	-Buttons
	-Button
	
Of course, the Buttons and Button components will be for handling user input, while Display will handle the logic of the mathematical operations. It will be a simple calculator with digits 0-9, and operators for addition, subtract, multiplication, and division. I may change my mind and add more as I progress through building it, but this is the plan I am starting with.

I will continue to post updates as I progress in the project.
